1. Solar Map of Massachusetts
  * View the degrees of solar radiation (GHI) at various coordinates in Massachusetts.
  * Move the time slider to see GHI over time during the year of 2015!
  * This visualization can be used to predict the best location of solar panels and perhaps outline some geographic boundaries of Massachusetts.
2. Categorizing Science Articles with Natural Language Processing (NLP)
 * This visualization shows how k-means clustering classifies various science articles.
 * The real category scraped from the actual website is shows as well to compare.
 * Take a look at the Jupyter notebook to see more about the text precessing and the ML model training that was involved.
3. Twitter Sentiment Analysis to Predict Airline Reputation
 * In this visualization, I use classic twitter sentiment analysis (a naive bayes model trained on airline tweet training data) to plot negative tweets over time.
 * Large spikes in negative tweets correlates to a disastrous event that ruined an airline's reputation, for example a forced removal from the aircraft.
