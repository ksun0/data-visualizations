    "## Using Twitter Sentiment Analysis to Predict Trends in Airline Brands\n",
    "The goal of this open project is to use the classic, over-used twitter sentiment analysis in a more meaningful way. In ths past, I heard of friends using this analysis in predicting Ethereum prices, political elections, and much more. While scrolling through example training data, I found specific tweets toward airlines, and thought it would be cool to view the sentiments towards United Airlines, JetBlue, etc. over time. Hopefully my visualizations can detect rises and drops in the brand, for example a negative drop when United Airlines ejected the asian man a few months ago."
